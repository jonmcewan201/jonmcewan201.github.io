 		So far so good. The layout is rough and I'm running way behind schedule so I need to get this closed up and move on to the next lesson ASAP. This time around, of course there are typefaces and spacing being applied. Though I cannot quite figure out how to get the slogan closer to the headline. Of course, I assume in a future iteration, The Daily Grind will be a logo and the slogan may well become the headline. We'll see how this evolves.</p>
